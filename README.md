# Assignment 2: Analyzing and Implementing Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of divide-and-conquer algorithms, including their analysis and practical implementation. You will analyze the time complexity of algorithms using asymptotic notation and solve recurrence relations.

## Assignment Tasks:
# 1.	Asymptotic Analysis and Recurrence Relations (30 Points):
Choose two divide-and-conquer algorithms, such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort. For each algorithm:
1. Describe the problem it solves and outline its key steps.
2.	Provide a detailed analysis of its time complexity using O, Ω, and Θ notations.
3.	Write the recurrence relation representing the algorithm's time complexity and solve it using the substitution method, recursion-tree method, and master method where applicable.
4.	Discuss the practical implications of the algorithm's efficiency in real-world applications.

# 2.	Implementation and Comparison (20 Points):
Implement the two chosen algorithms in a Python.
1. Compare the implementations by running them on various datasets, including sorted, reverse sorted, and random data.
2. Record and analyze the performance metrics, such as execution time and memory usage.
3. Discuss any observed discrepancies between theoretical analysis and practical performance, providing possible explanations.

## Formatting Guidelines:
1.	Your written analysis should be 3-4 pages in length, double-spaced, using a standard 12-point font (e.g., Times New Roman).
2.	Include a title page with your name, student ID, course title, and assignment number.
3.	Include well-commented code snippets and graphs/tables of performance metrics where relevant.
4.	Include a link to your GitHub repository.
5.	Cite any references used in APA format.

## Submission Instructions:
1.	Submit your written analysis and implementation code through the course's online portal.
2.	Ensure your analysis and explanations are clear, well-organized, and free of grammatical errors.
